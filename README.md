# AI-Powered Fraud Detection for Banking

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a personal project, born from a desire to honor and understand the critical work of validating financial transactions, particularly inspired by my father's role as a bank employee. His daily task of discerning legitimate transactions from scams, which heavily relies on **KYC (Know Your Customer)** principles, highlights a process that can be significantly enhanced by technology. KYC is a process where financial institutions **verify the identity of their clients and assess their suitability, along with the potential risks of illegal intentions**.

Our aim is to develop an innovative Artificial Intelligence model that implements KYC with a distinct approach. By analyzing various transaction parameters, this AI will assist bank personnel in efficiently **sorting and identifying the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent**, thereby streamlining and securing the validation process. This initiative seeks to **enhance financial security and build trust** within banking operations.

## ‚ú® Features & Methodology

This project utilizes a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to achieve its objectives:

* **Data Acquisition:** We will work with a dataset comprising **2,500 bank transactions**.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and transforming raw data into meaningful features crucial for model performance.
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:**
    * **Correlation Matrix:** Employing a correlation matrix to identify key features for model building.
    * **IQR Method:** Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method for data visualization, making the entire dataset clearly visible and informing subsequent data processing steps.
    * **Specific Correlation Visuals:** Visualizing the correlation between `Occupation` and `Savings Balance` to uncover insights.
    * **Elbow Visualizer:** Applying the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for data segmentation.
* **Clustering:** Grouping similar transaction patterns or customer behaviors.
* **Classification:** Developing a robust AI model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
* **Anomaly Detection via KYC:** The model will detect anomalies based on critical KYC parameters such as `customer behavior`, `withdrawal amounts`, `savings balances`, and `customer occupation`.
